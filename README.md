# SpotifyAlwaysWrapped
A Spotify Wrapped that is available all year round, so you don't have to wait until December for Spotify to summarise your listening habbits!

This requires some knowledge of Python and the use of the Spotify Dev Portal at the moment. I do have plans to make this into an app, however there is a known licensing issue on Spotify's end which prevents tracks from properly displaying. Therefore I won't be working on this until that is resolved.
